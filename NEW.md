- improved logging
- improved credential settings for munin and glowroot (stability and security)
- more robust setup
- possible to specify different ubuntu version for each containers (`guestos_version` in `containers.json` or via `dhis2-create-instance -o <os version>`)
- container type journal_logger
  - configure services output to journal (journald)
  - configure DHIS2 to log to journal
  - configure all containers to ship logs to the journal_logger container
  - ship the logs outside the journal_logger container. Supported backeds are (for now): host filesystem and S3 providers (aws, gcp, contabo, linode, digitalocean)
- container type siem_es
  - setup a SIEM based on Elasticsearch
  - configure all containers to extract logs from journald and send them to elasticsearch via filebeat
